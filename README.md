# Enterprise™ Web3.0™

<img src="logo.png" align="right" />

Enterprise™ Web3.0™ is a parser and compiler for the
[Enterprise™](https://github.com/joaomilho/Enterprise) language.

Enterprise™ Web3.0™ is designed to create internet programs that disrupt markets.

Enterprise™ Web3.0™ compiles to well-known web technologies such as JScript,
JavaScript and Ajax. It also allows you to write Web2.0 applications, although
they are not so disruptive.

### What's in it?

A full implementation of the [Enterprise™](https://github.com/joaomilho/Enterprise)
specs, plus some add ons:

#### More comments!

Enterprise™ Web3.0™ adds a brand new type of comments to Enterprise™:

##### because IE comment

```
/ie
  because IE
ie/
```

#### More Enterpresey™ terms!

Since the original spec is not adapted to the Web3.0™, Enterprise™ Web3.0™ adds
some new terms for you:
